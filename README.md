**stayinside** allows you to learn something new every time you open your new tab page! It reccomends to you something new every day on your New Tab page for you to try, and you can click on the button to see more details on Reddit and YouTube, which is where the ideas and inspiration for learning something new is sourced. You can log in, create an account, and add your friends to compete with them and see how is completing their goals every single day, which is displayed by the calendar on the right.

Fight the COVID-19 pandemic by staying inside and doing your part in social distancing!

## Usage

Download the latest release candidate, which at the time of writing is [0.1-beta](https://www.github.com/gideontong/stayinside/releases) from the releases tab, and load the zipped package into your web browser of choice.

You will also need to set up a server, which can be found in the `/server` directory of the repository. It requires Node.js to run and you can run it using `npm run dev`.

## Future Plans

We plan to integrate Google Calendar in the future so you can view your calendar at a glance as well every time you open the tab.
